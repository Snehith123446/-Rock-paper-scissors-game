# -Rock-paper-scissors-game
I build an mini project Rock paper scissors
Using javascript 
It is simple basic rock paper scissors game which take input from user and generates
random choice and declare the who won and count the points 
Things we can take away from this project 
1. working of funtions(arrow functions)
2. about event listenrs
3. DOM manipulation
